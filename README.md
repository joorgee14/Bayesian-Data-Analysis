# Bayesian-Data-Analysis

This course consisted in working with statistics from a bayesian point of view. We have seen:

- Conjugate distributions
- Gaussian modeling
- Simulation models for bayesian estimation
- Bayesian linear and non-linear regression models
- Bayesian clustering
It mainly consisted on a conceptual part, pen and paper, and a computational part, with R.

Practical Case- Bayesian Prediction of Bluffing in Poker:

This project applies Bayesian inference to estimate a poker player's bluffing probability. Using a Beta prior and updating it with observed hands, we obtain a posterior distribution that refines our belief about the true bluff rate, providing a more robust and uncertainty-aware estimate useful for real-world poker decision-making.
